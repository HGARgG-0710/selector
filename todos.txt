1. Documentation [finish the API]; 
2. Testing - parser, generator: 

	2.1. BUG [parser]: during parsing, the post-escaped (under-6 length) spaces MUST NOT become parts of a string...; 

		PROBLEM.
		THOSE FUCKING SPACES. 

		THEY ARE __NOT__ ALWAYS MANDATORY. 
		ONLY UP TO THE POINT THAT THE CHARACTER IN QUESTION __IS_NOT__A_HEX_VALUE!

		TODO: adjust the parsing of the escaped sequences to this (and the spaces, respectively)
	
3. In future: 

	3.1. Completely reverse the parser (reverse every tokenizer/sub-parser)
	3.2. Create validation API; 
	3.3. Add a 'specificity' function for calculating specificity of a given selector
	3.4. Create (generally) a 'Formatter' API to the 'parsers.js'.
